# colourMatching-swingGui
I've made this program here (~240 lines) in which the user has to match their RGB Panel(right) with a randomized color on the left. It's a pretty fun program, and I suggest you try it out! It's fully runnable as is.

But a lot of the code seems repetitive and I was wondering how it could be condensed and made any more efficient if possible. Any other tips would be greatly appreciated. This is my first java program in a few years so I may have broken some unwritten rules.

My biggest concern with this program is the repetitiveness of the JButtons and the functions which they run. There are 6 buttons, one that adds red, one that subtracts red, one that adds green, one that subtracts green, one that adds blue, and one that subtracts blue. The functionality is very similar because they all either increase or decrease the color by 15, so I was wondering if there was a way to condense them all into just one function. Thanks!
